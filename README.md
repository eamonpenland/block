# Compiled Steps
## Smart Contract Variation

### Insight Decetralized Consensus Fellow, 2019

Everyday new smart contracts are published to Ethereum’s blockchain. Some contracts perform simple exchanges while others initiate complex iterative processes between parties. Smart contracts are also subject to multiple forms of attack. ‘Compiled Steps’ is a tool to quantify the smart contract landscape through edit distance analysis which, I think, is a step towards understanding vulnerabilities, use case variability, and uniqueness amid solidity machine code.
